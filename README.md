## Challenges We Ran Into

While building the Scroll Hacks Project, we faced challenges related to user authentication and managing user accounts. Initially, we struggled with ensuring that users could not sign up with the same email address multiple times. We resolved this issue by implementing an in-memory account storage system that checks for existing emails during the sign-up process.
